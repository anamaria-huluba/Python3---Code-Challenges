Python Code Challenges 
Control Flow

1. Large Power
For the first code challenge, we are going to create a method that tests whether the result of taking the power of one number to another number provides an answer 
which is greater than 5000. We will use a conditional statement to return True if the result is greater than 5000 or return False if it is not. 
In order to accomplish this. 

We will need the following steps:
Define the function to accept two input parameters called base and exponent
Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent
Use an if statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return True. Otherwise, return False

# large_power function here:
def large_power(base, exponent):
  if base**exponent >5000:
    return True
  else:
    return False
    
# Testing my large_power function:
print(large_power(2, 13))
# prints True

print(large_power(2, 12))
# prints False

In this solution, I used an example of how the operation can be performed in the condition of the if statement. 
This prevents us from needing to create an extra variable. If the condition is true, then the indented code is executed which returns True, 
otherwise the indented code in the else statement is executed.

2. Over Budget
Let’s say we are trying to save some money and we are watching our budget. We need to make sure that the result of our spending is less than the total amount we 
have allocated for each of the categories. Our function will accept a parameter called budget which describes our spending limit. 
The next four parameters describe what we are spending our money on. We need to sum all of our spendings and compare it to the budget. If we have gone over budget, 
we will return True. Otherwise we return False. 

Here are the steps we need:
Define the function to accept five parameters starting with budget then food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, and rent
Calculate the sum of the last four parameters
Use if and else statements to test if the budget is less than the sum of the calculated sum from the previous step.
If the condition is true, return True otherwise return False

# budget function here:
def over_budget(budget, food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, rent):
  if (budget < food_bill + electricity_bill + internet_bill + rent):
    return True
  else:
    return False

# Testing my over over_budget function:
print(over_budget(100, 20, 30, 10, 40))
# prints False

print(over_budget(80, 20, 30, 10, 30))
# prints True

Similarly to the last problem, we can perform the operations within the condition of the if statement to prevent us from creating an extra variable. 
We calculate the sum and compare it to budget at the same time and return True if the condition is met, otherwise we return False.

3. Twice As Large
In this challenge, we will determine if one number is twice as large as another number. To do this, we will compare the first number with two times the second number. 

Here are the steps:
Define our function with two inputs num1 and num2
Multiply the second input by 2
Use an if statement to compare the result of the last calculation with the first input
If num1 is greater then return True otherwise return False

# twice_as_large function here:
def twice_as_large(num1, num2):
  if (num1 > 2 * num2):
    return True
  else:
    return False

# Testing the twice_as_large function:
print(twice_as_large(10, 5))
# prints False

print(twice_as_large(11, 5))
# prints True

In this function, we also performed the operation within the condition of the if statement. 
The second input is multiplied by 2 and then compared to the first input on the same line.

4. Divisible By Ten
To make things a bit more challenging, we are going to create a function that determines whether or not a number is divisible by ten. 
A number is divisible by ten if the remainder of the number divided by 10 is 0. Using this. 

We can complete this function in a few steps:
Define the function header to accept one input num
Calculate the remainder of the input divided by 10 (use modulus)
Use an if statement to check if the remainder was 0. If the remainder was 0, return True, otherwise, return False

# divisible_by_ten() function here:
def divisible_by_ten(num):
  if (num % 10 == 0):
    return True
  else:
    return False

# Testing my divisible_by_ten() function:
print(divisible_by_ten(20))
# prints True

print(divisible_by_ten(25))
# should print False

In this solution, we perform the modulus operation within the condition of the if statement. We test if the result is equal to 0 and if it is, 
then we return True otherwise we return False.

5. Not Sum To Ten
We are going to check if the summation of two inputs does not equal ten. Our function will accept two inputs and add them together. 
If the two numbers added together are not equal to ten, then we will return True, otherwise, we will return False. 

Here is what we need to do:
Define the function to accept two parameters, num1 and num2
Add the two parameters together
Test if the result is not equal to 10
If the sum is not equal, return True, otherwise, return False

# not_sum_to_ten function here:
def not_sum_to_ten(num1, num2):
  if (num1 + num2 != 10):
    return True
  else:
    return False
    
# Testing not_sum_to_ten function:
print(not_sum_to_ten(9, -1))
# should print True

print(not_sum_to_ten(9, 1))
# should print False

print(not_sum_to_ten(5,5))
# should print False

We begin by adding our parameters within the condition of the if statement. Next, we use != to compare the sum to 10. 
If they are not equal then our function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
