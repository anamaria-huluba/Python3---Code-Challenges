Dictionaries - Scrabble Project

In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.

letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"]
points = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10]

Build your Point Dictionary

1. We have provided you with two lists, letters and points. We would like to combine these two into a dictionary that would map a letter to its point value.

Using a list comprehension and zip, create a dictionary called letter_to_points that has the elements of letters as the keys and the elements of points as the values.

letters_to_points = {letter: point for letter, point in zip(letters, points)} 

2. Our letters list did not take into account blank tiles. Add an element to the letter_to_points dictionary that has a key of " " and a point value of 0.

letters_to_points[" "] = 0
print(letters_to_points)

3. We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how many points that word is worth.

Define a function called score_word that takes in a parameter word.
