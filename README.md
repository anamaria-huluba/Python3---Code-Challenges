# Python Code Challenges with Codecademy

I got an introduction to fundamental programming concepts and the Python programming language syntax. More specifically, I learned about:

How to write Python syntax to print and work with user input
How to use Python control flow, boolean variables, and logic operators to create programs that can make dynamic decisions
How to utilize the list data structure to store and manipulate ordered groups of data
How to use loops to reduce code repetition and effectively execute a group of statements several times
How to create functions to organize code into reusable blocks
How to work with the string data type to automatically create, rearrange, reassign, disassemble, and reassemble blocks of text
How code in Python is grouped and shared across a codebase via modules
How to utilize the dictionary data structure to organize information in a key-value format
How to work with files in an automated way
How the relationship between a class and an object works to create object-oriented code
